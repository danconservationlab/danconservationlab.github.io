# DAN Conservation Lab

Welcome to the **Diversity and Nature (DAN) Conservation Lab**, led by  
**Dr. Dan Liang, Associate Professor at the School of Ecology, Sun Yat-sen University at Shenzhen**.

We study ecological and social dynamics in rapidly changing ecosystems, with a focus on:

- Migratory birds  
- Coastal ecosystems  
- Direct mortality and conservation solutions  
- Human–wildlife coexistence  
- Social–ecological system research  

Our work integrates **field research**, **remote sensing**, **ecological modeling**, and **socioeconomic surveys** to develop sustainable conservation strategies.
